# Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in files and allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project.  
It’s widely used for source code, documentation, and configuration management.


## Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A folder where all project files and their history are stored. 
- **Commit**: A snapshot of the current state of files in a repository. 
- **Branch**: A separate line of development to work on new features or fixes.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another. 
- **Local vs Remote**: Local repository exists on your computer, remote repository exists on a server like GitHub.


## Why Git Matters

- Tracks changes and keeps a history of work. 
- Allows collaboration without overwriting others’ work. 
- Enables rollback to previous versions if something breaks. 
- Supports branching for safe experimentation.
