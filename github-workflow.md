# GitHub Workflow

A workflow is a series of steps that helps you manage your project efficiently using GitHub.

## Typical Workflow Steps

1. **Clone the repository**: Copy the remote repository to your local machine. 
2. **Create a new branch**: Work on a feature or fix without affecting the main branch. 
3. **Make changes and commit**: Save changes locally with descriptive commit messages. 
4. **Push the branch**: Upload your branch to GitHub. 
5. **Open a pull request**: Request to merge your changes into the main branch. 
6. **Code review and merge**: Team members review changes before merging. 
7. **Delete the branch**: Clean up after merging to keep the repository organized.
