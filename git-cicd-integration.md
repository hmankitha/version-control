# Git & GitHub in CI/CD

Version control is a key part of modern development and deployment. 
Git and GitHub integrate with CI/CD tools to automate builds, testing, and deployments.



## Common Use Cases

- **Automatic Builds:** Trigger builds whenever code is pushed. 
- **Automated Testing:** Run tests automatically on each commit to catch errors early. 
- **Deployment:** Deploy code to servers or cloud environments after tests pass. 
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous versions quickly if deployment fails.
